# Hello!

***About me:***

I am a current Statistics MS student based out of Los Angeles, CA.  While my primary professional experience is in education and science communication, I am looking to transition into the field of data science and statistics.  Posted here is a selection of projects and papers highlighting some of my recent work.

Brief summary of the projects posted above:

* *Predicting Class Drop-Outs in Secondary School Mathematics*: This is a re-analysis of a 2008 paper predicting student outcomes in high school mathematics.  We compare the performance of LASSO logistic regression, random forest, kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), and vanilla logistic regression.  All analysis performed in R.

* *Time Series Analysis of Heartrate in Endurance Running*: A series of ARMA time-series models are fit to heart rate data gathered during endurance running, performing short-term forcasting in a 60-second time horizon.  All analysis performed in R.

* *Analysis of Team-Level NBA Statistics and Regular Season Performance*: NBA regular season performance is analyzed based on 14 commonly-used summary statistics.  Dimension reduction (PCA) and regularized regression are used and discussed.  All analysis performed in R.

* *BIOSTAT 257 Homeworks - Computational Linear Algebra*: Selected assignments involving optimizing the speed and memory allocation of common statistical computations such as PageRank and linear mixed effects likelihood.  All analysis performed in Julia.

* *M231A Homeworks - Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition*: Selected assignmnets deriving and/or implementing common machine learning algorithms.  All analysis performed in Python.

Enjoy!
