# Hello!

***About me:***

I am a current Statistics MS student based out of Los Angeles, CA.  While my primary professional experience is in education and science communication, I am looking to transition into the field of data science and statistics.  Posted here is a selection of projects and papers highlighting some of my recent work.

Enjoy!
